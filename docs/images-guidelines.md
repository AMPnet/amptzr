# Images guidelines

There are several places in the app where users can upload images that are used for a number of purposes. Follow the proposed tips to ensure that the end users have a decent experience while using the app.

## Issuer

- logo
  - dimensions: square, horizontal wide
  - file format: svg (preferred), png, jpeg
  - quality: mid
  - locations: top left in the appbar
- favicon
  - dimensions: square
  - file format: fav, jpeg, png, svg
  - quality: 128x128 (preferred)
  - locations: browser tab

## Asset

- logo
  - dimensions: square
  - file format: svg (preferred), png, jpeg
  - quality: mid to high, not greater than 1024x1024
  - locations: used as a token symbol on many places (in small circles), in cards on admin pages.
  - additional comments:
    - prefer having a decent padding in the image so, when it ends up in a fully rounded cycle, it doesn't crop the content.

## Campaign

- main image
  - dimensions: square, wide, ultra-wide
  - file format: png, jpeg
  - quality: mid to high, compressed
  - locations: offer cards, cards in admin pages.
  - additional comments:
    - a single image will be used both as landscape and portrait
    - prefer images that are versatile, so they can be cropped both horizontally and vertically without losing its content
    - prefer using an image without meaningful content on the edges, but rather in the center
    - be conservative with the image quality and don't upload ultra-high quality images
